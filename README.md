# @svgd/icons-material

A single-file collection of Material UI icon paths.

This package exports `icons/paths.js` with over six hundred icon path strings.
The accompanying TypeScript declarations include base64 encoded previews so
that supported editors show the icon image right inside tooltips.

```js
import { Abc } from '@svgd/icons-material';
```

All icons are gathered in one file which avoids thousands of small files in
the original MUI icons packages. A static HTML preview is available on GitHub Pages.
